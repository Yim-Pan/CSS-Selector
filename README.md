HTML CSS Selector is the core and basic component of the browser to support the execution of Javascript scripts. It is also a query and data extraction method supported by many Internet data collection software (such as Scrapy). This project aims to model the HTML DOM hierarchy through a tree data structure, and implement common HTML CSS Selector and corresponding operations such as obtaining text, HTML, and links. Finally, a CSS selector based on C++ was implemented.
